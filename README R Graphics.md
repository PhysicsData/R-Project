	Recreate the “Mpg by Cylinder Count” graph, and mark the mean mpg for 4 cylinder cars, 
	the mean mpg for 6 cylinder cars, and the mean mpg for 8 cylinder cars.  
	This will be similar to the first boxplot example.  Submit the code and the modified graph.

	Using the mtcars data set, recreate the following graph.  
	Note that the y axis starts at 0 and the x axis starts at 1.  Submit the code and your graph.

	Using the command plot(-5:5,-5:5,type="n",xlab="",ylab="",frame=FALSE), 
	you can create a 10 by 10 blank canvas to draw on.  Execute this command, and then recreate the following picture. 
	The red curve is the function y=x^2 and the blue curve is the function y=-x^2.
